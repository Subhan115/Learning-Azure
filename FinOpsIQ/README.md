# FinOpsIQ – AI-Powered Azure Cost Anomaly Detection

**FinOpsIQ** is an intelligent, serverless FinOps platform that helps cloud teams detect unusual Azure cost spikes early and understand them in simple, business-friendly language. It automatically monitors daily spend, uses AI to explain what caused each spike and what actions to take, and generates a weekly one-page summary of the top cost risks and savings opportunities.

______________________________________________________________________

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of FinOpsIQ is to **reduce wasted cloud spend** and make cost insights **clear enough for both engineers and managers to act on quickly**—without requiring manual budget guesses or constant monitoring.

______________________________________________________________________

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Spike Detection**: Alerts when daily spend exceeds X% above your normal baseline (user-defined threshold).
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Plain-language insights like *"Spend is 67% above baseline due to VM scale-out in prod-eastus. Action: Review autoscale rules."*
- **Weekly Manager Scorecard**: 1–2 minute read summarizing top cost risks, trends, and savings opportunities.
- **Multi-Tenant Ready**: Single deployment monitors multiple Azure subscriptions with per-tenant configuration.
- **Production-Grade Security**: Managed identity, Key Vault secrets, 90-day data retention, full audit trail.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Azure Cost Management → Blob Storage (daily CSV export)
                              ↓
                    Azure Function (Python)
                    - Detects spikes (user-defined %)
                    - Calls AI Foundry for explanations
                              ↓
                    Logic Apps → Email/Teams alerts
                    Blob Storage → Anomaly records + weekly scorecards
```

**Core Services**: Azure Function App, Blob Storage, AI Foundry, Key Vault, Logic Apps, Application Insights, Entra ID (Managed Identity).

______________________________________________________________________

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Daily**: Azure Cost Management exports cost data to Blob Storage.
2. **Function Trigger**: Python Function reads new CSV, calculates baseline (7-day avg), detects spikes.
3. **AI Analysis**: Azure AI Foundry generates plain-language explanation + action items.
4. **Alerting**: Logic Apps sends instant email/Teams notification if spike detected.
5. **Weekly**: Aggregated scorecard sent to managers (top risks + savings opportunities).

______________________________________________________________________

## 🛡️ Security

- **Managed Identity**: Function accesses all Azure services without secrets.
- **Key Vault**: Stores AI API keys securely.
- **RBAC**: Least-privilege access via Entra ID.
- **Data Retention**: 90-day automatic cleanup via Blob lifecycle policies.
